# Fine Outlines

### Change the black outline color of icons! 

Rob originally teased this for 2.2 but it never got added, so here I am!!
This mod requires no extra configuration, and it supports all texture packs out of the box due to some fancy shader magic!

**<cg>To use this mod, edit your icon color and click the color pallete button in the glow tab</c>**
