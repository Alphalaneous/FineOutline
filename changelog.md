# 1.0.1
- Tweak the shader's extraction algorithm to not catch normal colors as often.
- Setting the color to black disables any icon shaders rather than leaving the custom ones with no visual effect (useful for colored icons, as previously it would still affect those).
- Fixed a bug where dying in the editor removed the outline.
- Fixed a bug where icons selected using More Icons would show the default icon outline.

# 1.0.0
- Initial Release.
